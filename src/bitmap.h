 * Bitmaps should be saved in a file that uses the established bitmap
 * file format and assigned a name with the three-character .bmp extension.
 * The established bitmap file format consists of a BITMAP_FILE_HEADER structure
 * followed by a BITMAP_INFO_HEADER, BITMAP_V4_HEADER, or
 * BITMAP_V5_HEADER structure.
 * An array of RGBQUAD structures (also called a color table) follows the bitmap
 * information header structure.
 * The color table is followed by a second array of indexes into
 * the color table (the actual bitmap data).
 * The bitmap file format is shown in the following illustration.
 * +--------------------+
 * | BITMAP_FILE_HEADER |
 * +--------------------+
 * | BITMAP_INFO_HEADER |
 * +--------------------+
 * |   RGBQUAD array    |
 * +--------------------+
 * | color-index array  |
